# React Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio to host my projects and give some information about myself to anyone that might need my services in the future.

- My motivation for this app was to begin to build my brand and allow potential clients a place to see my work to decide if I can help them.
- I built this project to house all of my projects in one place for easy access.
- While building this app, I learned quite a bit about React and things like state management.
